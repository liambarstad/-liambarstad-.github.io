          I have just come into contact with people who have, for all intents and purposes, BUILT Apollo, the part of my stock machine that searches the internet automatically (Bandwidth
          specific and all). Hands on training will commence shortly. This is beginning to feel like less and less of a fever dream each day :)

        <article class="Posts">
          I've just finished the first module in my 7 month long trek at Turing, and the change within me is palpable. It's interesting, how one can learn to be unafraid of breaking things,
          taking them apart, and putting them back together. In my time off, I have found myself dissecting random electronic devices, just to curb an insatiable lust for understanding. The development
          of that dynamic alone is worth tuition. In addition, I feel that I am developing an ability to learn how to use technology faster. This is a welcome development, as sucking it up and learning
          a new application, language, or program, oftentimes saves more than its worth in time and energy in the future. In order to plan my weekend, for example, instead of writing everything down,
          I took the time to learn how to use google calendar on my phone. It was a small change, but it will noticeably improve my schedule for years, and it only took about 30 minutes. If I was
          not empowered with Turing gusto, I would have forgone that entire process (if it isn't broken, don't fix it right?). And look at me coding in HTML! Downright radical.
